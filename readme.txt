a. I came at my code pretty straightforward. at first i made the min heap at that took a while to fix. after figuring that out it worked well.

b. best case is big omega average is big theta and worst case big o(n)

d.the more numbers that are being passed in the array the less the time it takes to sort
each element

e. for heapsort its pretty much the same run time all across because it doesn't change much.

f. in terms of usability i think it doesn't need to be improved because i commented well and made the program pretty straightforward to any user.
in terms of efficiency i got a bad pointer error early on so i decided to use regular arrays so switching back to pointers would probably be a good idea.
